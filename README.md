# F1Tenth Framework Setup

This repository contains step by step instructions on how to install and run the set of software required for an F1tenth Vehicle (including simulation).

## Installation Options

The installation procedures depend on your hardware specification and preferences. Open the appropriate folder to follow your specific set of instructions. We have instruction sets for the following:

- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) with ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Docker Container Installation which should work on any system that supports Docker Engine, including Ubuntu 24.04, Windows, and MacOS

> [!TIP]
> We recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS 2 Foxy since this is the most stable installation.
